                    <b>HTML</b> stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language.</em> which is what defines most web pages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    HTML is made up of the following...
                  <br>
                    Text content shows what you see.  
                  <br>
                    Markup shows what your page will look like.
                  <br>
                    References to other documents, such as images are possible.
                  <br>
                    Links to other web pages are possible too.

                  <b>HTML</b> uses tags in a certain structure to create a webpage, such as !doctype, head, title, body, etc.
                    <br>
                      <b>Tags</b> are what HTML uses  to mark text in a certain way.  
                    <br>
                      A tag normally has an opening tag, text, then a closing tag. 
                    <br>
                      Tags that do not contain content are called "void" tags.
                    <br>
                      I learned how to use <b>bold</b> and to provide emphasis via the <em>italics</em> tags.

                      Tags can be either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.

                      Inline tags examples are break, bold, emphasis, void tags, new lines, etc.
                    <br>
                      Block tags create an invisible block around the content.  Examples of this is paragraph and div.

                    <b>1 - What a Web Page is</b>
                      <br>
                    A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
                      <br>
                    <b>2 - How Coding Works</b>
                      <br>
                    Coding happens when one writes text in a language that a computer can understand.  The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
                     <br>
                   <b>3 - Computers are       Stupid</b>
                     <br>
                   Programmers need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax")
                     <br>
                   <b>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b>
                     <br>
                   There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make test italic on HTML, you can always just look it up.
                     <br>
                   <b>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>
                     <br>
                     <br>
                   You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
                     <br>
                   <b>Tag:</b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags, called "void" tags do not require a closing tag.
                    <br>
                  <b>Element:</b> A HTML element referes to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
                    <br>
                  <b>Attribute:</b> This is a property of a HTML element.

                    A Webpage uses structure, css, and JavaScript. <b>Structure</b> is like the walls of your house that defines rooms.  <b>CSS</b> shows the style, much like paint or decorations in a room. <b>JS or JavaScript</b> creates the interactive components, much like the remote control or a garage door opener in your house.

                    <b>DOM - Document Object Model</b> is the tree like structure most commonly used today.
                      <br>
                    <b>Rectangles</b> are used to represent any element, even if it looks like something else.  These rectangles are used on an imaginary grid to account for the space on a page.

                  <p>
                    <b>Inheritance</b> is the use of DOM to relay properties between ancestors and descendents.
                    Descendents can get text based properties, but not box-related properties.  
                    Inheritance cuts down on repitition, uses less CSS, faster web page loading, saves money on bandwidth and developmental costs.

                  <p>
                    <b><em>Text based examples</em></b> are color, font, line spacing, line height, list style, text align, text indent, visibility, etc.

                  <p>
                    <b>Selector</b> decides what style gets applied.  It is defined by a class name, along with attributes and values.

                  <p>
                    <b>Box Model</b> consists of a margin, border, padding, and content.  
                    <em>Padding</em> can be adjusted by background.
                    <em>Border</em> can be adjusted by the color property.
                    <em>Margin</em> is the space between boxes.
                    <em>Width</em> consists of content + left and right border + left and right margin.

                        <br>
                      <b>Assign</b> variables by using the equal sign.  
                      In the world of variables, equal does not mean the same as a mathmatical equal sign.
                      It simply means it has been assigned a value.
                        <br>
                      <b>Values</b> can be literal via the use of quotation marks. For example, value = "4" + "4", would produce an outcome of 44.  Without the quotation marks, the values would be added together mathmatically.  So, value = 4 + 4, would produce an outcome of 8.
                        <br>
                      <b>Variation of variables</b> is common.  
                      This can be done by assining a variable to itself, along with some action, like +1.
                      Then the variable takes on a new value.  
                      Varying varibal values give flexability to the programmer to not have to rewrite the same formulas.

                      It does not matterif single or double quotation marks are used, as long as they match.
                      If no quotation marks are used, the computer thinks the entity is a variable.

                      <b>Operators</b> mean something different with strings, than their original mathmatical purpose.
                      <em>Plus</em> means to concantenate values.
                      <em>Multiplication sign</em> defines a quantity.
                        <br>
                      <b>Selecting Sub Sequences</b> is a way to ask the computer to define a location within a string.
                        <br>
                      <b>Square Brackets</b> are used to request this location.
                      The computer numbers each value starting at 0 for this position identifier.
                      A value can be requested on it own.
                      It can be calculated.
                      It can be defined as a range by using a colon within the square bracket. 
                      When a range is defined, it does NOT include the last value.
                      If you leave the range request open ended, then the last value is included.
                      If no value meets the request criteria, then a negative one is the result.
                        <br>
                      <b>Indexes</b> can be used in addition to the position request.
                      Position requests will find the <em>first</em> item match.
                      An index can be defined to tell the computer to find the first match, but only <em>after</em> the postion number listed as an index.
                      This method can be used to find and replace things within a string.

                      <b>Functions</b> are programming statements/routines that can use multiple inputs to produce an output.
                      The concept of multiple inputs makes functions attractive to programmers by performing repeated actions without rewriting code.
                        <br>
                      <b>Defining a function</b> is done by using the <em>def</em> command, a function <em>name</em>, and a <em>parameter</em>, ending in a colon.
                      The quantity of inputs is defined via the parameter portion of the function.
                      Functions allow for multiple inputs.  This allows programmers to set parameter values based on outputs of other functions.
                        <br>
                      <b>Using a function</b> is setting the values of the input.  It is returning the output or result.
                      Functions are valuable because it allows processes or procedures to be performed using a small amount of code.
                      Functions can be linked to perform multiple actions.
                        <br>
                      <b>Return</b> command tells the function to produce output.  
                      Without it, the fuunction still performs it's action.  It just does not show the results.
                      If the result does not exist or there is no answer, the function will have NONE for its output.
                        <br>
                      <b>Procedure Composition</b> is the term used to describe the activity of using procedures within procedures.

                      <b>Comparison Operators</b> such as greater than, less than, equal to are used to compare variables and values.  
                      An equality comparison uses two == signs.  This is to be different than a single =, meaning to assign value.
                      Exlaimation point can be used to mean <em>NOT</em> as it relates to the value.
                      The output of this comparison is either true or false.
                        <br>
                      <b>IF loops</b> are used when a comparison of some kind is required.
                      The <em>block</em> or set of instructions are only followed if the IF loop warrants a <em>TRUE</em> result.
                        <br>
                      <b>ELSE statements</b> can be used in conjuction with the IF loop to define what happens if the IF loop warrants an answer of FALSE.
                        <br>
                      <b>OR Operator</b> can be used to logically determine if a statement is true.
                      If the first expression is true, the value is true.  With this result, the second expression is NOT evaluated.
                      If the first expression is false, the value is determined by the second expression.

                      Until then, the content of the loop will keep processing.
                        <br>
                      <b>Break</b> is a way to stop the processing, even within a loop.

                      <b>Debugging Strategies</b>
                        <br>
                      1.  Examine error messages.  This should be used when the program crashes.
                        <br>
                      2.  Work from example code.  This should be used to methodically change one thing at a time.
                        <br>
                      3.  Make sure your examples work.  There is no point in building on something that does not do what you want.
                        <br>
                      4.  Check (print) intermediate results. This can be used when the program does not crash, but results are unexpected.
                        <br>
                      5.  Keep and compare older versions of code.  This will allow you to go back and see your code without bugs being introduced.

                      <b>Structured Data</b> is using list formats to store data elements.  
                      This structured data is as if it was formatted in boxes in which element can be affected individually.
                        <br>
                      <b>Strings and Lists</b> can look very similar.
                      But there some differences.  For instance, 
                      strings are made up of a sequence of characters that create one string.  
                        <br>
                      List can be made up of a sequence of anything.
                      These things can be strings, numbers, even lists within lists.
                        <br>
                      Lists are defined using square brackets.
                        <br>
                      A set of two square brackets identify an empty list.
                        <br>
                      If a list request is made and there is no data that meets that request, an index out of range error message will be returned.
                        <br>
                      <b>Nested Lists</b> are list within lists.  
                      This can be useful to organize data and associations.
                        <br>
                      Each element can be <em>indexed</em> using square brackets and the corresponding position number within the list.  
                      Calculations can be performed on this data.
                      If the list is too long to put on one line, they start the next line after a comma.

                      <b>Mutation</b> is the concept of changing the value of a list after its creation.
                        <br>
                      This is different than data manipulation where a string value can be redefined, but not really mutated.
                        <br>
                      Lists items are defined as though they are in individual boxes, which are subject to mutation.  
                        <br>
                      As mutation happens it is important to note changes happen  to the data.  But the list is still the same like, but with a different value associated.
                        <br>
                      <b>Aliasing</b> is when multiple variable values point to the same list.  
                      As the list is changed, both variables are actually affected.
                        <br>
                      This is important to understand for when values do not come out as expected.  Aliasing could be the cause and must be acknowledged.

                      <b>Append</b> adds more elements to the list.
                      This operation is called by the listname.append (element). This appended element can be a varible that represents another list.
                        <br>
                      <b>Plus Operator</b> adds a list to another list.  This works much like the <em>concantenate</em> feature.  
                      It does not acutally add values together as much as to add list elements to create a new list of all the elements.
                        <br>
                      <b>Len</b> stands for length.  This is used to determine the length of a list.  This counts the main elements within one list.  
                        <br>
                      So that means if there is a list within a list, only one list element would be counted for the len function.

                      <b>Problem Solving</b> is done in a methotical way to keep yourself from getting confused and writing code that does not work.
                        <br>
                      <b>Step 0</b> Understand the problem.Starting to write code without this first is not fruitful. 
                        <br>
                      Break it down into small peices in order to ensure you understand what is expected.
                        <br>
                      <b>Step 1</b> What are the inputs?  
                        <br>
                      Make sure you understand the data that will be provided and in which the format will be.
                        <br>
                      <b>Step 2</b> What are the outputs?
                        <br>
                      Determine if it is appropriate to PRINT or RETURN.  Return allows for more options, such as caluclations later.
                        <br>
                      <b>Step 3</b> Solve the problem.
                        <br>
                      Make sure you have a good understanding of the input and outputs relationship.  
                        <br>
                      First try to systematically solve the problem in the way a human would think.
                        <br>
                      Try to think if there is a need for some type of helper program to perform checking or a solve a intermediate problem.
                        <br>
                      <b>Step 4</b> Develop a simple mechanical solution.  This can be done by writing pseudo code for what needs to happen.
                        <br>
                      Humans always look for shortcuts. Sometimes the easiest way to solve a problem seems to be overwhelming or redundent for a human, but no big deal for a computer.  Always look for a simple way of doing things.
                        <br>
                      <b>Step 5</b> Develop code incrementally and test each peice as it is written.
                       <br>
                      This will help you find errors quicker and will point to the specific peice of code that may be incorrect.

                    These called upon classes perform unseen fuctions.  For example, webbrowser actually calls the function <em>def open</em> automatically, behind the scenes. 
                      <br>
                    An <b>exception</b> is encountered when a referenced file already exists or when a file does not exist.  It basically says there is a problem with the reference.

                    <b>Python Standard Library</b> contains modules, which have many <em>classes</em> associated with them.
                      <br>
                    <b>Classes</b> are a set of rules, like a template or blueprint, which can define structure. 
                      <br>
                    When classes are called upon within a module, they initialize or set aside memory to be used for that specific class.
                      <br>
                    <b>Instances</b> of a class can be created.  This allows for the same set of rules to be used multiple times, and variations to be defined for each instance.
                      <br>
                    <b>Objects</b> are specific instances of a class.  And example would be if a class is "Candy Bar", then instances could be "Snickers", or "Heath Bar".  Each are candy bars, but they are different flavors, with different ingredients that make up their content.
                      <br>
                    <b>Benefits of using objects</b> is that you can define one set of basic rules via the class, and make slight changes to similar things based on the specific instance.  Classes allow a programmer to write code based on modular blocks of information, instead of rewriting detail multiple times.  So, the class rules/attributes can be used many times.
                      <br>
                    Using classes allows for one set of code to be reused multiple times for similar instances.  This is often done in a separate program, so it is easy to define the instance differences and maintain the modular structure.  
                      <br>
                    <b>Abstract Thinking</b> is a way of thinking about things that you cannot directly see.  For example, classes have built in functions that are not seen, but can be used in programming. I would use abstract thinking to conceptulize how to design a webpage.  I would think about the main steps needed to accomplish the goal. Then I would figure out the steps needed to do this.  Then I would think about what things I could block together to make the code easier.  For instance, if I were creating a page for a cookie cookbook, I would figure out things that I would be writing over and over again.  Those things, like the oven temperture, cooking times, mixing methods, etc could be classified as both variables and methods within a class.  The class could be created and called cookies.  I could create different instances of this cookie class called <em>chocolate chip</em>, <em>peanut butter</em>, <em>sugar supreme</em>.  Each instance could have their own set of ingredients.  They could inherit variables or methods from the predefined class itself.  An example would be that, in general, the same set of mixing rules would apply for all objects.  Those can be inherited. But, if  the sugar supreme cookies cannot be mixed... the ingredients must be put in a bag and shaken, this can be done by defining those specific instructions within the sugar supreme instance/object.
                      <br>
                    Another example of using abstract thinking in a programming is when multiple ccs styles are used in conjunction to HTML. A CSS style sheet file can be created using class selectors.  The class selectors create different instances that can be defined in different ways.  For example, I would look for things that I want to share the same type charactoristics.  I could create an object that defines a 26 Helvetica font for my concept headers.  I could use a different class selector and define 14 Times New Roman font, with red color, and a blue background for the concept descriptions.  I can call upon these different attributes in HTML by referencing my class file, containing these different class instances. If I chose to change the background element to purple, I can go to that class instance and make my change.  I would not have to go into the HTML document itself to make this change multiple times.  CCS style and HTML are independent files that work together to create the desired look of a webpage.

                    <b>Definition from Wikipedia</b> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A distinguishing feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this"). In OO programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] There is significant diversity in object-oriented programming, but most popular languages are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determines their type.
                      <br>
                    <b>Definition from Dictionary.com</b>
                    A schematic paradigm for computer programming in which the linear concepts of procedures and tasks are replaced by the concepts of objects and messages. An object includes a package of data and a description of the operations that can be performed on that data. A message specifies one of the operations, but unlike a procedure, does not describe how the operation should be carried out.
                      <br>
                    <b>Definition from PCmag.com</b> Writing software that supports a model wherein the data and their associated processing (called "methods") are defined as self-contained entities called "objects." Object-oriented programming (OOP) languages, such as C++ and Java, provide a formal set of rules for creating and managing objects. The data are stored in a traditional relational database or in an object database if the data have a complex structure. 
                    There are three major features in object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
                      <br>
                    <b>My definition</b> is OOP is a programming method that uses classes and objects.  Classes are called upon instances of memory to be used to perform a purpose. An object is an instance of that class.  Each object can contain its own set of attributes.  Some of its attributes can be inherited from other objects and/or can affect other objects.  An object can contain both functions and methods.  These objects are normally stored in a different program or place so that the main program can be written with ease and the objects can be defined separately from the operation of the objects themselves.  These object behaviors can be changed, modified, redefined, by changing the specific object itself, instead of rewriting the program as a whole.  It is easy to create another object that does exactly what you want within a class.  Classes have a set of built in functions that can be used in OOP.  There is a plethera of hidden functions called constructors that are utilized automatically without having to write out the specific code for them.  We utilized a class called Turtle. We created different instances within that class to create different shapes.  Those instances were similar, but different.  For example, they were all shapes.  But each instance of Turtle, called an instance or object, was defined to create different shapes.  The instances contained different instructions as to how to create the shape.  They had different colors and different instructions on how to create output.  Some of these instructions could have been inheritted from another instance, but were defined separately. 
                      <br>
                    <b>OOP Benefits</b>           <br> <em>Maintainabiliy</em> is easier because of the modular nature, you can isolate problems and update instances to do what you want, instead of large programming changes.
                      <br>
                    <em>Faster Development Time</em> because objects can be reused.  There is no need to recreate the wheel each time.
                      <br>
                    <em>Lower Cost</em> because the use of objects cuts down on the development time.
                      <br>
                    <em>High Quality</em> because OOP allows more time and energy to be spent on software verification.     <br>
                      <br>
                    Certain things that can be grouped together would deem well to using OOP. OOP allows for one file to be used to modulize data, whereas another file can be used to define the different instances. 
                    This allows for ideas to be grouped together as blocks in programming.  Then those blocks can be made explicit for each instance.  This cuts down on defining all the details for each item within the main program.  
                      <br>
                    They are merely a repository of classes you may want to used.  That can be called.
                      <br>
                    <b>Constuctors</b> are the <em>hidden</em> functions that initialize data within an instance or open files, etc.  
                      <br>
                    An example constructor is __init__.  This has two underscores to identify this is something special and is used often.
                      <br>
                    <b>Self Keyword</b> identifies the current instance at the time.  It is used like a pointer as different instances are called.
                      <br>
                    <b>Instance Variables</b> change based on a specific instance. 
                      <br>
                    They can be defined within the class itself, or can be called from outside the class using the name of the instance.
                      <br>
                    For example, an instance variable might be movie.title.  This value will change based on which instance is being used at the time.
                      <br>
                    <b>Instance Methods</b> are functions defined inside the class that would be identified using the keyword self.
                      <br>
                    <b>Constant Variables</b> are attributes that multiple classes can share because they are generally constant.  
                      <br>
                    These are identified by ALL CAPS. as a standard, to indicate they are constant variables.
                      <br>
                    <b>Inheritence</b> is a method in which classes can share variables or methods.  
                    It works like attributes that are passed from a parent to a child though genetics.
                      <br>
                    Inheritance is passed by using the first assigned class as the object of the second class.  This makes the second class reuse parts of the first defined class.
                      <br>
                    <b>Method Overriding</b> is when a method is defined within the "child" class by the same name.  When this happens, the child defined method is used, instead of what would have been naturally inherited by the parent defined method.
